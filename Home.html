    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      One afternoon at the library, we noticed a young boy struggling to read a
      novel. After approaching and speaking to him, we learned that he was
      visually impaired and had forgotten his glasses at home. After hearing
      about this, we were determined to use our programming skills to create an
      innovative app to help him and others like him. We developed Zardon Vision
      to utilize the mobile device’s camera to scan the surroundings to assist
      the visually impaired. We designed the app to have a clean and
      user-friendly interface, with large high-contrast buttons and clear
      instructions. Our aim was to create an app that would not only help the
      young boy we met at the library, but also others facing similar
      challenges.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Object Recognition</h1>
    <p>
      By utilizing the device's camera, the app can scan the surroundings and
      identify people and objects. We used a custom GPT-2 and PyTorch model. An
      image can get uploaded to our Flask server where it is identified and then
      it sends the information back to the app which reads out what the image
      was out loud. This feature would allow the user to understand his/her
      surroundings and navigate their environment with ease.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Text Recognition</h1>
    <p>
      Zardon can also take a photo of text to help a visually impaired person
      understand what it says. Using the Apple AI vision api, the app can
      automatically identify the borders of where the text starts and ends. The
      OCR software uses pattern-matching algorithms to compare text images,
      character by character, to its internal database. If the system matches
      the text word by word, it is called optical word recognition. The app uses
      advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology to scan and
      interpret text. With this technology, the app can capture text and convert
      it into audio, providing an immediate and accessible way for individuals
      to comprehend written communication such as books, documents, and signs.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Depth Perception</h1>
    <p>
      Disparity is the key concept behind perceiving depth. When observing an
      object, your eyes capture slightly different views, known as disparity.
      The brain utilizes this disparity to determine the object's distance. The
      iPhone Front camera employs a similar approach using two cameras and
      analyzing "feature points." Through a triangulation algorithm, the iPhone
      can compute the 3D position of each feature point, enabling it to
      determine the depth of objects within the scene. This technique proves
      valuable for various applications like augmented reality and portrait mode
      photography as it allows the iPhone to gauge the distance to different
      objects in the scene. This technology can allow visually impaired people
      to more easily navigate their surroundings without exterior aid.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Facial Recognition</h1>
    <p>
      Zardon Vision can also classify humans. By using a custom trained Yolov2 +
      Pytorch model we can somewhat accurately classify different people. Some
      difficulties we faced were overfitting(which occurs when a statistical
      model fits exactly against its training data.), inaccurate, no catch
      case(has to be either one or the other)
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Siri GPT</h1>
    <p>
      We used IOS shortcut platform to program an easy way for visually impaired
      people to get access to information quickly. Our app provides a link to
      the shortcut where users can set it up in less than 10 seconds. A user can
      then activate Siri and say “Hey Siri, Mini Helper”. You can then speak a
      request to a custom trained model based off of GPT-3 and Siri will then
      speak out the information that the model gave verbally.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Help Center</h1>
    <p>
      This page can help any visually impaired person receive help when they
      require it. They have the option of receiving help from a call center for
      general needs or specialized medical help from a hospital. We’ve also
      integrated a contacts page which allows any visually impaired person to
      promptly contact another person.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Technologies</h1>
    <p>
      We used a combination of Swiftui and UIkit for the frontend. We used
      Python, Flask, and PyTorch for the image recognition, For the text
      recognition, we used an Apple API called VisionKit and AVFoundation. We
      utilized html and css for the website. For the facial recognition, we used
      YoloV2, Create Ml, and pytorch.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h1>Struggles</h1>
    <p>
      For this project, we used mostly Swiftui. This is a newer framework that
      had a lot of issues. Especially with the camera so we had to use uikit for
      that stuff. This was also the first time the majority of our group had
      ever used Swift/App development. Additionally, the design process ended up
      being rather difficult. We had to consider the demographic that the app
      was designed for (visually impaired) and make sure that it could be easily
      used by them. We went through many different designs for our app and
      website till we came up with something that would work.
    </p>
    <h1>Impact</h1>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px">
      This app provides solution that enhances accessibility and has the power
      to revolutionize the lives of the visually impaired. Zardon Vision offers
      a new level of convenience by allowing the user to conveniently access
      written information. Moreover, the app has the potential to save lives.
      Object recognition and navigation assistance provide users with increased
      safety. Furthermore, this app serves as a precedent for future innovation
      by showcasing how this technology is capable of helping visually impaired
      people.
